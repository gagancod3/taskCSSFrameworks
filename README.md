# taskCSSFrameworks
How we can use multiple frameworks together.

There are multiple ways we can use Multiple CSS Frameworks together. 
Particularly BootStrap 5 and Material UI
What I have done here is " use particular framework on particular html tags" 
We have to make sure that we donâ€™t get confuse between different syntax of  frameworks 
We can add classes to those tags to distinguish which framework we have used on which tag.
